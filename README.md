# React Image Gallery



## Description
Weekend project for React week! A simple image gallery pulled from the database. Images also have a description and number of likes stored in the database

I will be revisiting this project in the future to add extra features to the application.

## Installation
1. Create a database called react_gallery and copy the provided query text into postgresql.
2. In a project terminal enter "npm install"
3. Open a second termainal, run "npm run client" on one and "npm run server" in the other to fire up the application

## Usage
Images from the database are displayed on the page. The image description can be view by clicking on the image. The description can be closed by clicking the "close description" button. An image can be liked by clicking the "like" button, the total number of likes is displayed on the page.
